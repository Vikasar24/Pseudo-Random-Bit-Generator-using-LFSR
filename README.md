# Pseudo-Random-Bit-Generator-using-LFSR
This project implements a simple Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) in C++ and JavaScript to generate pseudo-random bitstreams. It uses a seed, feedback taps, and stream length as inputs, and outputs the generated stream to the console and a file. Ideal for learning basic stream ciphers and randomness simulation.
